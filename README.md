# CalcBiomin
This repository includes scripts and input data to replicate the data analysis of the manuscript "Genetic parallels in biomineralization of the calcareous sponge *Sycon ciliatum* and stony corals“. Data used as input to the scripts, such as annotation files, count data, and information on the count data, blast results, etc., can be found in the folder “input_files”. Scripts are provided in the folder “Perl” and “R-scripts”. To use the R-scripts, define the working directory according to the comments within each script.
